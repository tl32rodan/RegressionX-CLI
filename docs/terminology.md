# RegressionX Terminology

## Baseline
The reference version of artifacts for a regression case. Baseline outputs are compared against candidate outputs to determine regression status.

## Candidate
The new or proposed version of artifacts for a regression case. Candidate outputs are compared against baseline outputs to determine regression status.

## Regression Case
A single, uniquely identified unit of execution. Each case defines parameters, metadata, and optional filtering overrides. A case produces baseline and candidate artifacts.

## Regression Configuration
The versioned, schema-validated contract that defines paths, versions, command templates, filters, reporting, and cases.

## Artifact
A file generated by case execution. Artifacts are stored in version-specific roots and are the primary inputs to diffing.

## Diff
The computed difference between baseline and candidate artifacts after applying include/ignore filters.

## Judgement
The PASS/FAIL/WARN status assigned to a case (and summarized globally) based on diff results and judgement rules.

## Filters
Include and ignore glob patterns that scope which artifacts are considered when computing diffs. Additional per-case ignore rules are permitted when explicitly allowed.

## Report
The structured output that records regression summary, per-case details, and differences.
